# IPF World Men's Classic Open Powerlifting Championships: Deadlift Statistics

## Background
There is a debate within the powerlifting community about whether to pull your deadlifts using a Hook grip or a Mixed grip. Each has its own pros and cons, with the main advantage of Hook grip being the reduction in range of motion, while Mixed grip is a lot less technical. At the most recent IPF World Championships, there were quite a few missed attempts due to grip and I wanted to analyze to see what the most popular grip and stance (Sumo or Conventional) were, as well as know the deadlift impact on the overall total for each weight class. Finally, I wanted to measure the grip failure rate. To do so, I have created an interactive dashboard in Power BI.

The pie charts show the percentage of each grip/stance used in the 2024 World Championships and also display the most popular combination of grip and stance used.
### Deadlift Impact on Total

The stacked bar chart shows how much their deadlifts contributed to their overall total.

Compared the two grip styles and their fail rates, as well as the number of attempts failed due to grip.
